# The Next Generation Audio Devices Product Page

This website is a website deployed with github pages designed to give more information about the plans of our headphones.

## Pages

### Index (Home)
At the landing page, you are greeted by the pre-loader if your internet connection is slow, otherwise, you are welcomed by the headphones stock photo, the design we are trying to achieve. Scroll down and the parallax effect of each image will mean that they are anchored to the background. Each block will convey a goal/feature.

### Innovation

This is where we planned to show off the 3D model and schematics files along with a few card for our features that you can click into and find details; however, due to time-constraints with setup and deploymeny of the index page, these goals were not accomplished. We are only able to offer you a cards for the features and a schematics file that Andy gave me to put up.

### Contact/Order Now!

This page was originally planned as a contact us page where we would leave some information to allow others to view a FAQ. This turned into a an order now page where you are able to submit a request and buy a product. This is still in testing phase so you are able to input a fake creadit card to submit a purchase request.



We invite you to test this out and find out any bugs
Note: the header and footer is the same across all three pages.
